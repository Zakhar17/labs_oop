# House Builder Application

## Objective

Develop a house builder application that allows users to create customizable houses. The application should support two key features: creating a house from a prototype and building a house using a builder pattern.

## Requirements

1. Implement a House class that stores information about the house's number of rooms, number of floors, and color.

2. Implement a HousePrototype class that allows creating new House instances by cloning an existing prototype.

3. Implement a HouseBuilder class that allows constructing a House step by step using a builder pattern.

4. Create a clear and organized project directory structure with separate folders for the House, HousePrototype, and HouseBuilder classes.

5. Create a `main.py` file that demonstrates the usage of the HousePrototype and HouseBuilder classes to create House instances.



## Deliverables

1. Source code for the House class.

2. Source code for the HousePrototype class.

3. Source code for the HouseBuilder class.

4. `__init__.py` files for each folder to simplify imports.

5. `main.py` file demonstrating the creation and usage of House instances using the HousePrototype and HouseBuilder classes.

6. A well-organized and clean project directory structure.

7. A `readme.md` file containing the developed technical task.
