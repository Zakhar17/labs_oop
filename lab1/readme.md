### Task: Create a cross-platform UI toolkit for designing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for desktop applications.

### Decomposition of the Task:
- a. Design basic UI components (e.g., Button, Label, and Textbox)
- b. Create platform-specific UI component factories (Windows, macOS, and Linux)
- c. Implement a higher-level UI component factory for creating platform-specific components
- d. Implement a UI designer that uses the Abstract Factory to create platform-specific UI components

### OOP Patterns:

- Factory Method: Use this pattern to create platform-specific UI components (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

- Abstract Factory: Use this pattern to create a higher-level UI component factory for creating platform-specific components.
