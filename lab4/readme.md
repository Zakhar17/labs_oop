# E-commerce Order Processing System

## Objective

Develop an e-commerce order processing system that supports multiple order processing steps using the Macro Command pattern and customizes order processing steps using the Template Method pattern.

## Requirements

1. Implement a base OrderProcessor class that defines the template method for processing an order.

2. Implement concrete order processing classes that extend the base OrderProcessor class and customize the processing steps using the Template Method pattern.

3. Implement the Macro Command pattern to execute multiple order processing steps as a single command.

4. Create a clear and organized project directory structure with separate folders for the OrderProcessor and MacroCommand classes.

5. Create a `main.py` file that demonstrates the usage of the OrderProcessor class and the Macro Command pattern.
