# Image Processor Application

## Objective

Develop an image processor application that allows users to apply various processing operations to images. The application should support three key features: applying processing operations using the strategy pattern, notifying observers about image changes using the observer pattern, and executing/undoing image processing commands using the command pattern.

## Requirements

1. Implement a base ImageProcessor class that stores an image and allows applying processing operations to it.

2. Implement processing operations using the strategy pattern.

3. Implement an observer mechanism to notify observers about changes in the image.

4. Implement a command mechanism to execute and undo image processing operations.

5. Create a clear and organized project directory structure with separate folders for the ImageProcessor, Strategy, Observer, and Command classes.

6. Create a `main.py` file that demonstrates the usage of the ImageProcessor class and its features.

## Note:
For the purpose of brevity and simplicity, the code below uses a placeholder for actual image processing operations. In a real-world application, you would replace this with an actual image processing library such as PIL (Pillow) or OpenCV.
