# Playlist Management System

## Objective

Develop a playlist management system that supports custom playlist iteration using the Iterator pattern, manages playlist states using the State pattern, and handles user commands using the Chain of Responsibility pattern.

## Requirements

1. Implement a Playlist class that supports custom iteration using the Iterator pattern.

2. Implement a PlaylistState class that manages the playlist state using the State pattern.

3. Implement a Chain of Responsibility pattern to handle user commands related to the playlist.

4. Create a clear and organized project directory structure with separate folders for the Playlist, PlaylistState, and CommandHandler classes.

5. Create a `main.py` file that demonstrates the usage of the Playlist class, PlaylistState class, and the Chain of Responsibility pattern.
